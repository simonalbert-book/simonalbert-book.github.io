Hello, my name is Simon, a product design student.

I am a 19 year old French student in the second year of a DNMADe Object (“Diplôme National des Métiers d’Art et du Design”), a three-year higher education degree in France that combines art, design, and traditional craftsmanship. My studies focus on the creation and design of crafted objects.
I am particularly interested in the manufacture of musical instruments and the various areas of craftsmanship, such as woodworking and metalworking.
